<a href="/"><h3 style="font-size: 1.3em;">ABOUT DAN</h3></a>
<p>Hi there! Welcome to my website! I'm Dan and I'm a self-taught Python developer
	from Romania currently living in Dublin, Ireland.</p>


<p>This website has been written in Python using Django as a web framework.
	It contains a photo gallery, a blog section where I explain all of the Python projects I do, a contact page, and
	who knows what else I will be adding to it. It is hosted on Heroku.</p>

<p>I also have a Wordpress blog at <a href="http://dan.saigon.ro">dan.saigon.ro</a>
	where I usually write everything I want to remember related to web development.</p>

<p>If you want to contact me (for any reason) please check my contact page.
